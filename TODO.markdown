TODO list for the gorrdpd project
=================================
There is no priority on these tasks, just brain dump.

* Write project documentation
* Add comments over the project source code
* Add ability (command-line argument) to resolve IP addresses
* Trap SIGTERM signal (and maybe SIGUSR) to flush all slices on soft kill
* Write tests for the project
* More benchmarking needed
* Resolve absolute path of the "gorrdpd" binary to detect data directory path
* Research on librrdtool usage, maybe it will be faster than executing as an external command
* Create client libraries for different languages
